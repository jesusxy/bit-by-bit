## ðŸ§© `bit-by-bit`

bit-by-bit is a curated collection of low-level programs and systems-oriented experiments, designed to explore core computing concepts and internal mechanisms through hands-on implementation.

Each project investigates a foundational question in (systems) programming, for example:
- What are the mechanics behind manual memory allocation?
- How does the call stack behave at runtime?
- How might a SQL engine or JavaScript runtime be implemented from first principles?

Inspired by the book `But How Do It Know?`, these projects are learning artifacts not production tools, crafted to deepen my understanding of how computers actually work, one bit at a time.
