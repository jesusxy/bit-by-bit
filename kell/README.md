# kell

Inspired by the concept of a caul, `kell` is a minimalist Kubernetes operator that acts as a thin, controlling layer between user intent and underlying cluster resources.

This project is an experiment in understanding the core reconciliation loop and control patterns that power Kubernetes automation, built from first principles.

### Current Status

Phase 2: Manual deployment of the test application to Kubernetes is complete. The next phase is to begin building the operator itself to automate this process.
