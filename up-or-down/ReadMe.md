Write a program in C that can compute if the stack grows "up or down"

## Goal

- Display knowledge of how the stack is working under the hood.
  - Which direction is the stack growing?
- Display knowledge of writing a program in C

If the stack grows upwards the `_address_` of the stack-frame is _INCREASING_ \
Conversely, if the stack grows downwards the `_address_` of the stack-frame is _DECREASING_
